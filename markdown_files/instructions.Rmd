Bias detection is a meta-analytic procedure which aims to assess the reliability of a certain batch of literature. This   
can be a meta-analytic dataset, work done by a specific scientist, or even a whole Journal. In this app, you can   
perform this procedure yourself and all you have to do is choose a keyword.  

Think about which scientific topic you want to assess. Choose a keyword that is associated with it and proceed to the   
second page.
