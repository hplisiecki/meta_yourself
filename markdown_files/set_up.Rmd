Above you can type your keyword, or settle for the one that we have picked for you. Using the slider, you can set   
the limit on the maximum ammount of articles that will be downloaded to perform the bias detection. Setting the   
limit low will help the app run faster, however it will also limit the precision of bias detection. The articles    
collected by the app come from the PLOS library.  


Below you will be able to see the titles of the articles downloaded by the app, together with their first authors.   
Keep in mind that only those that include relevant statistics will be used in the meta-analysis. You can change the     
keyword if the list of articles does not satisfy your needs. Once you have settled on the right one, proceed to   
the last page to see the results.    

Please stand by...
